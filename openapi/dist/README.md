# hardenize_org_api

HardenizeOrgApi - JavaScript client for hardenize_org_api
Hardenize is a platform for continuous monitoring of network and security configuration. Hardenize supports individual accounts, intended for use by a single person, and organization accounts, which are shared among potentially many individuals. Whereas individual accounts are limited, organization accounts can have access to all Hardenize features. The Organization API, documented here, provides ability to manage and retrieve information from organization accounts.  At this time, because we're still developing these APIs, they are not enabled by default for all organizations. Please contact us so that we can enable the APIs for you. After that you'll be able to generate your API credentials in the Settings section.  **This specification is a work in progress and may change without notice.**

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/),
please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install hardenize_org_api --save
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing 
into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

Finally, switch to the directory you want to use your hardenize_org_api from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

You should now be able to `require('hardenize_org_api')` in javascript files from the directory you ran the last 
command above from.

#### git
#
If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.
https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file, that's to say your javascript file where you actually 
use this library):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var HardenizeOrgApi = require('hardenize_org_api');

var defaultClient = HardenizeOrgApi.ApiClient.instance;

// Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic HTTP Authentication
var Basic HTTP Authentication = defaultClient.authentications['Basic HTTP Authentication'];
Basic HTTP Authentication.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
Basic HTTP Authentication.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

var api = new HardenizeOrgApi.CertificatesApi()
var body = "body_example"; // {String} PEM-encoded certificate

var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
};
api.createACertificate(body, callback);

```
